# Releasing

Releases are automated. **semantic-release** runs on `main`, derives the next
version from the Conventional Commits since the last tag, updates the changelog,
tags, and publishes to npm. There is nothing to do by hand for a normal release
— merge to `main` and the pipeline ships it.

## The one manual gate: the memo epoch

There is exactly one decision a release author must make that automation cannot:

> **If this release fixes a case where earlier releases could WRONGLY PASS, bump
> `EPOCH` in `src/memo/key.ts` in the same PR.**
>
> **When in doubt, bump** — the cost is one round of live re-derivation across
> open PRs (spec §8), and it fails closed.

### Why

A memo record says "these staged inputs derived this lockfile, and that was a
pass." If a release *tightens* the check (catches something it used to miss),
every memo minted by an older, laxer version may now be asserting a pass the new
version would reject. Those records are keyed under `EPOCH`; bumping the integer
invalidates all of them at once, forcing a fresh live derivation under the new
semantics. A record can only short-circuit to a pass, so a stale-but-not-bumped
memo is precisely how a fix could silently fail to take effect.

Keying on the epoch rather than the tool version is deliberate: the tool version
changes every release and would needlessly flush every open PR's memos each
time; the epoch changes only when the check's *pass semantics* changed in a way
that could have wrongly passed before. It lives as a source constant (not
config) so a binary can never write under an epoch it does not know about
(spec §8, "Epoch — revocation shipped with the validator").

### The rule of thumb

- **Bug fix / behavior change that could make a previously-passing input now
  fail** (a hole closed, a tightening) → **bump `EPOCH`**.
- Pure additive feature, docs, refactor, or a fix that only ever makes the check
  *more lenient* → no bump.
- **Not sure which?** → bump. Forgetting is silent (old memos keep short-
  circuiting); an unnecessary bump just costs one live re-derivation round.

Records always carry the writing tool version and a timestamp, so after an
incident "every pass minted by ≤ vX" is one query over the store — which is also
why old-epoch records are never pruned.
